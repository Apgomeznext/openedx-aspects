xAPI Concepts
#############

Introduction
------------
xAPI, also known as the Experience API or Tin Can API, is a specification for capturing 
and tracking learning experiences in a wide range of contexts. It is an e-learning 
standard that allows organizations to gather data about learner activities and interactions
across various platforms and devices. xAPI provides a flexible and comprehensive
framework for collecting, storing, and analyzing learning data, enabling a deeper
understanding of learners' experiences and performance.

Components of xAPI
------------------
The xAPI specification consists of three key components:

.. _actor_concept:

Actor
~~~~~
In xAPI, an actor represents an entity that interacts with the learning system.
It can be a learner, instructor, system administrator, or any other agent 
involved in the learning process. Actors are identified using a unique identifier,
such as an email address or username.

Statement
~~~~~~~~~
A statement, also referred to as an "xAPI statement" or "verb-object statement,"
is the core building block of xAPI. It captures a specific learning activity
or experience in a structured format. A statement consists of three essential
elements: the actor who performed the action, the verb that describes the action,
and the object representing the target or learning experience.

Learning Record Store (LRS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Learning Record Store serves as the repository for storing and retrieving xAPI
statements. It is a database or storage system that receives and securely stores
the statements generated by learning activities. The LRS enables the collection 
and organization of learning data from various sources, allowing for robust 
analysis and reporting of learner experiences.

Together, these components form the foundation of the xAPI ecosystem, enabling
the tracking and analysis of learner activities and experiences beyond traditional
learning management systems. The flexibility and interoperability of xAPI make it
an ideal solution for organizations looking to gain deeper insights into their
learners' performance and behavior.
