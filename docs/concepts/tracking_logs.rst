Tracking Logs
*************

The event-tracking library tracks context-aware semi-structured system events. It captures 
and stores events with nested data structures in order to truly take advantage of schemaless
data storage systems.

This library produces trackings logs which can be stored in multiple destinations. Those trackings logs
are used to generate reports and dashboards.
