9. Personally-identifying information (PII)
###########################################

Status
******

Accepted

Context
*******

The vast majority of event data processed by Aspects is anonymized to protect user privacy. Most events have an "actor",
and that actor is uniquely identified by an anonymous user ID.

But some of the community's analytics use cases call for the use of Personally Identifying Information (PII) that is
stored in Open edX. For example, to identify and intercede with learners that are struggling in a course, we need to see
the contact details for that learner. Or if we want to use use demographic data in recruitment campaigns to improve the
diversity of a student group, we need access to user profile fields like country, state, gender, and age group.

Storing and displaying PII must be done with care, so this document describes the steps needed to protect this data and
help institutions to use it responsibly.

Decision
********

**Opt-in Aspects PII**

If operators opt-in, Aspects will store PII from Open edX, including User Profiles and a mapping between users and the
anonymous user IDs used in event data.

Aspects will also construct PII-specific dashboards, charts, and datasources when PII is in use. Access to all event
data in Aspects is restricted to users with a "staff" or "instructor" role on the course, and the PII dashboards will
also carry these restrictions.

**Removing PII after opting-in**

If operators choose to opt-out after opting-in to Aspects PII, they are responsible for removing the relevant PII tables,
datasources, dashboards, and charts.

**Aspects supports user retirement**

Aspects will integrate with the user retirement pipeline (if it is enabled on the LMS) allowing users to retire their
user accounts and have their PII automatically removed from Aspects.

However, the retired user's event data will not be removed from Aspects, as they remain anonymized.

Consequences
************

#. Operators must opt-in to storing PII in Aspects by enabling the `ASPECTS_ENABLE_PII` configuration flag.
#. Operators who opt-in and then opt-out of storing PII can remove any PII from Aspects by clearing the
   `EVENT_SINK_PII_MODELS` tables in Clickhouse.
#. Aspects will use the standard Open edX annotations for code that references PII.
#. User retirement events in the LMS will trigger removal of PII for retired users.
#. How-to documentation will be created for operators enabling and managing PII.

Rejected Alternatives
*********************

**Don't use PII in Aspects**

Following the Open edX policy of storing and sharing the minimum personal data necessary, Aspects Instructor and
Operator dashboards do not use PII.

However the community use cases were too compelling to ignore, and so we were not able to keep PII out of Aspects.
