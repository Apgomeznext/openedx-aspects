# OARS

The Open Analytics Reference System (OARS) for Open edX!

There is a line chart in the background, trending upwards. The man notably has poles in his hands instead of oars, proving the ultimate futility of trying to achieve perfection visualization from large sets of messy data. :)](docs/_static/OARS_logo.jpg "OARS Logo")

## What is OARS?

As a reference system, OARS is one possible implementation for analytics for the Open edX LMS. It
will contain documents, templates, and recipes for how to change or extend the implementation for
different applications, but primarily be a recommended "batteries included" set of configuration
and plugins to combine 3rd party tools into a powerful and flexible system.

## What _isn't_ OARS?

A deployable application in-and-of itself, it helps deploy other applications together using 
Tutor plugins and customizations to well-supported, existing, third party applications.

## Status

OARS is in early development by efforts from The Center for Reimagining Learning and Open edX 
community contributors. You can follow design, development, and implementation at the [Data 
Working Group issue board](https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects/5/views/1).
