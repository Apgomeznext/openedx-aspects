# Aspects

Learner analytics for Open edX!

## What is Aspects?

Aspects is an optional implementation of analytics for the Open edX LMS. It is the combined solution of Cairn by Overhang.io and the OARS project developed by Axim Collaborative with a huge amount of help from the Open edX community. Primarily it is intended to be a "batteries included" set of configurations and plugins to combine 3rd party tools into a powerful and flexible system for learner analytics.

## What _isn't_ Aspects?

A deployable application in-and-of itself, it helps deploy other applications together using Tutor plugins and customizations to the Open edX platform to connect well-supported, existing, third party applications.

## Status

Aspects is in development by efforts from Axim Collaborative and Open edX community contributors. You can follow design, development, and implementation at the [Data Working Group issue board](https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects/5/views/1).
